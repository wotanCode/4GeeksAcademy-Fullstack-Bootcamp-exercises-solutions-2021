# `02` Hello World

In Python, we use `print` to make the computer write anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in something called `the console`.

Every language has functions to integrate with the console, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning (before the Windows or Linux or MacOS arrived). Today, printing in the console is used mostly as a monitoring tool, ideal to leave a trace of the content of variables during the program execution.

This is an example of how to use it:
```js
print("How are you?")
```

## üìù Instructions:

Use print to display "Hello World" on the console. Feel free to try other things as well.
