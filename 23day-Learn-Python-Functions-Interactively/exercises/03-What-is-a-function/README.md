# `03` What is a function?

You can see a function as a **fragment of code** we can use  several times.

For example: If we want to get the sum of two numbers, we can declare a function called `sum` that returns the sum of number1 and number2:

```python
def sum(number1,number2):
  return number1 + number2
```

After the function is declared we can use it as many times as we want, like this:

```python
total = sum(2,3)
total2 = sum(5,10)

print(total) # prints 5 on the terminal
print(total2) # prints 15 on the terminal
```

# üìù Instructions

Please calculate the sum between **3445324** and **53454423** and assign the result to a variable called `super_duper`
