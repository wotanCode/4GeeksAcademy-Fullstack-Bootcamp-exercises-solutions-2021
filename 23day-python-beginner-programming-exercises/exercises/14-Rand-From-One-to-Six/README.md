# `14` Rand From 1 to 12


## 📝 Instructions:

1. Change whatever you need to change to make the algorithm print random integers between 1 and 12.
This time use **randrange()**

## 💡 Hint:

- It should print between 1 and 12, not between 0 and 12.
- This exercise is super simple, don't over complicate things....
