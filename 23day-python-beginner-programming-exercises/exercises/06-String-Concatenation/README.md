# `06` String Concatenation

One common task you’ll need to accomplish with any language involves merging or combining strings.
This process is referred to as concatenation.
The best way to describe it is when you take two separate strings – stored by the interpreter – and
merge them so that they become one.

```py
one = 'a'
two = 'b'
print(one+two); #this will print 'ab' on the console.
```


## 📝 Instructions:

1. Set the values for my_var1 and my_var2 so the code prints 'Hello World' in the console.
