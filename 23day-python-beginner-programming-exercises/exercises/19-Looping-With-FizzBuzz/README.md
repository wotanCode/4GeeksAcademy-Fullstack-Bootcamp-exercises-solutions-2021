# `19` Looping With FizzBuzz

This is a typical beginner test that is required to complete interviews in Google, Facebook and all the other big tech unicorns.


## üìù Instructions:
Write the code needed to print in the console all the numbers from 1 to 100.
1. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz".
2. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
3. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
