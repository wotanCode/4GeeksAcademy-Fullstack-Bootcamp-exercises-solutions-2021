# `04` Multiply Two Values

Any programming language lets you do basic Math operations like multiplication, division, etc.

To multiply 2 values in python, you have to use the asterisk operator like this:
```py
resulting_value = 2 * 3
```
In this case, we stored the result value of the multiplication into a variable called **resulting_value**.
