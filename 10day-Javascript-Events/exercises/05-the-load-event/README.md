# `05` The Load Event

It is a very good practice to wait for the browser to finish loading the page before starting the flow of your website/application, to do so, we use the LOAD event.

## 📝 Instructions
Create a function called loadListener that listens to the load event and alerts the string "loading finished..." when called.

## 💡 Hint:
- The listener has to be assigned to the body.
