# `08` Event Target

Every event has useful information that you can use during the runtime. 

For example:
- If a user clicks on a button you can know what specific button the user clicked
- If the window is scrolled you can know how much was scrolled
- If the user moved the mouse, you can know the mouse position
- and much more!

When you declare any event-handler function, you can use an optional parameter that contains the event information like this:
`function myFunctionName(eventInformation){}`
This parameter can have the name that you want, and you can trust that it will always contain the information of the event that was triggered. For example the eventInformation.target property will return the object that triggered the event.

## üìù Instructions
This website already has a listener for the click on the #container div. Please prompt an alert with the id of the target element (the element that was clicked).
