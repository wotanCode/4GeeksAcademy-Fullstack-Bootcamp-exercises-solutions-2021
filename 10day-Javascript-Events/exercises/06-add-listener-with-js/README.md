# `06` Add Listener With JS

Sometimes we need to add event listeners DURING RUNTIME.

The best way to do that is using the addEventListener function on any DOM element that we want to start listening to.

## 📝 Instructions:
Right now this code is listening for the load and it prompts an alert when the website finishes loading. Write the necessary code to alert "wuju" whenever the green button is clicked.

## 💡 HINT
Here is the documentation for addEventListener: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener

Use the function `alert()`.

And this is how your website execution should look like:
