# `07` Count on Click

If you have global variables, you can change their value during runtime using event handlers. For example, this code is increasing the value of the variable counter every time the user clicks on the #increase button.

## 📝 Instructions

Create a decrease button with an event handler function. The function should decrease the counter variable and update the screen.
