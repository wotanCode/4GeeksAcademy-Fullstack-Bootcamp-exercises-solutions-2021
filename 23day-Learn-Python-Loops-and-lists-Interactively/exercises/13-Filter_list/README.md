# `13` Filter list

Another looping function that is available on python is the `filter function`.
Its main purpose is to remove elements from the original list and return a new list with the result.
The code on the left is filtering the odd numbers from the allNumbers list.

# 📝Instructions

1. Please update the filtering function so it filters all the numbers bigger than 10.

```py
Expected output:

[ 23, 12, 35, 54, 21, 534, 23, 42 ]
```
