# `05.1` Sum the odd numbers


# 📝Instructions from your teacher:

1. Create a function called sumOdds that sums all the odd numbers in the "arr" variable.
2. Returns and print the result.

# To do this exercise consider:

- You will need to `declare an auxiliar variable outside the loop` to keep adding the values.
- create a function
- You have to `loop the list`.
- On each loop, you have to ask if the value of the list in that index position is an odd number.
- If its odd then add the value to the `auxiliar variable`.

💡Hint:
An auxiliar variable is a regular variable, the only difference is a logical difference; an
auxiliar variable is like a chosen one, it'll be useful until it completes its purpose (add all the values,
make a copy of a value, etc).
