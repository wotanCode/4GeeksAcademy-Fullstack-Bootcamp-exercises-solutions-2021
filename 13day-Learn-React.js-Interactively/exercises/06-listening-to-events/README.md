# `06.0` Listening for events

Events work in react pretty much the same way they do in Vanilla JS: if you want to listen for the user `Click`, all you have to do is add your onClick property (or any other event) to the HTML tag. Business as usual.

# :speech_balloon: Instructions

The current code has one component that prints "I was clicked!" to the console.
- Update the **Alert** component to call it correctly and then check the console.
