# `01` Welcome

My name is Alejandro Sanchez [@alesanchezr](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr). I'm really excited to have you here !! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜‚
Learning to code is hard, you need coaching! DM me on twitter if you have any question.

During this course you will be learning the following concepts:

1. **Using JSX**: A great syntax proposed by Facebook that mixes HTML and JS in the same file to help you write dynamic HTML.
2. **How to building components with React.js**: The web is now being made using components: Angular, VUE, React, etc. All of them propose "component oriented" developments.  
3. **All the tips to generate dynamic HTML**: In the end, that is the main front-end developer objective: Creating dynamic HTML.  
4. **Using JS Modules**: Splitting your code into different files is the best way to organize and optimize your projects.  

> :small_blue_diamond: We built the exercises incrementally, you should feel the progress little by little, and hopefully, the difficulty raising between exercises will never be too big to get you frustrated.
