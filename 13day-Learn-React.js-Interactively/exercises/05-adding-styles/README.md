# `05` Adding styles to the components

The most recommended way to do styles on React is using CSS-in-JS.

Basically you create an object with your styles like this:

```JS
const mySuperStyles = {
    color: "blue",
    fontSize: "14px",
    border: "1px solid black"
};
```

And then you can apply those styles to your HTML like this:

```jsx
    <div style={mySuperStyles}>I am an alert</div>
```

# :speech_balloon: Instructions

The current exercise has an object with styles applied already, please update the the styles to meet the following:

1. Font size has to be 16px
2. Background color has to be black.
3. A yellow border with 1px.
