These exercises were built in collaboration, we need you! If you find any bugs or misspells plese contribute and report them.

<h2>One click installation:</h2>

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/master-python-programming-exercises.git)


## Local Installation

1. Install learnpack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the html compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 12+:

```
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-python
```

2. Download this particular exercise using learnpack and `cd` into the folder:

```
$ learnpack download master-python-programming-exercises
$ cd master-python-programming-exercises
```

Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level were your bc.json file is:

```sh
$ RUN  pip3 install pytest==4.4.2 pytest-testdox mock
$ learnpack start
```

Note: The exercises have automatic grading but its very rigid and string, my recomendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recomendation or you can get frustrated.


## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.py:** represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.py:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
