# `08` Remove DOM Element Part One


If you want to remove an element from the DOM, you have to use the removeChild function.
The challenge behind this function, is that it needs to be called from the parent of the element that you want to remove. For example, in this code:
```html
    <ul>
        <li>First element</li>
        <li>Second element</li>
        <li>Third element</li>
    </ul>
```
To remove the second element, we need the function removeChild from the parent UL, but passing, as a parameter, the `<li>` that I want to remove.

Something like this:

```js
    let element = document.querySelector("#element-id");
    element.parentNode.removeChild(element);
```
## üìù Instructions:
