# `10` Render on Click

User interactions normally require changes in the DOM. We use events for that. 
If you don't feel comfortable with events please complete all [the exercises here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-events-tutorial-exercises).

## 📝 Instructions:

Using the createElement function, create a DIV container with yellow background 
and "Hello World" as innerHTML, append that DIV into the body of the website when 
the users clicks on the `#superDuperButton`

### 💡 Hint:
- get the button with the getElementById function
- Add a click event listener to the `#superDuperButton`
- Inside of that listener function, add the needed code to create the element and appended to the body as a child.

Expected result:
