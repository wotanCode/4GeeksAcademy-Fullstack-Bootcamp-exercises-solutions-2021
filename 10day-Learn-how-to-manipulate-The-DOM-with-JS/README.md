This tutorial is part of a bigger group of tutorials about web development, this repository focuses only on The DOM, you will learn how to select elements from your website and manipulate them with Javascript (change styles, add event listeners, remove elements programmatically, change your entire website without a refresh).

You can [start the tutorial online](#one-click-installation) in just 10 seconds or [download the source files](#local-installation) to do it locally.

I strongly recommend doing this the tutorials in this order:

1. [Introduction to HTML](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-tutorial-exercises-course)
2. [Introduction to CSS](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/css-tutorial-exercises-course)
3. [Introduction to Javascript](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial)
4. [Introduction to The DOM](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-dom-tutorial-exercises) ‚Üê you are here now üî•
5. [Using events & The DOM](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-events-tutorial-exercises)
6. [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/object-oriented-javascript-tutorial-exercises)

<h2>One click installation:</h2>

## Local Installation

1) Make sure you have the [breathecode-cli](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli) installed and `node.js` version 10+ and python version 3+. This is the command to install the breathecode-cli
```
$ npm i breathecode-cli -g
```

2) Clone or download this repository. Once you finish downloading, you will find a new folder with a subdirectory "exercises" that contains all the exercises within.

3) Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
$ npm i jest@24.8.0
$ breathecode run
```

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.js:** represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
1. **index.html:** represents the entry website.
1. **style.css:** your website styles, they have to be imported from the index.html
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
