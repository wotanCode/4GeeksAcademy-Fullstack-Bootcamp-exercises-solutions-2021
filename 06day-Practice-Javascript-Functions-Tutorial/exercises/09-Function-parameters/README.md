# `09` Function parameters

You can specify as many parameters as you want in a function- as a developer you are going to find functions with even 6 or 7 parameters  all the time. The names of the parameters don't matter, but you have to be as explicit as you can because those names will give clues to the other developers (or yourself in the future) about what is each parameter about.

# 📝 Instructions:
Please write the "renderPerson" function required to print a a string like the following:

```js
Bob is a 23 years old male born in 05/22/1983 with green eyes
```

# 💡 Hint
You have to do some string concatenation and return that string.
