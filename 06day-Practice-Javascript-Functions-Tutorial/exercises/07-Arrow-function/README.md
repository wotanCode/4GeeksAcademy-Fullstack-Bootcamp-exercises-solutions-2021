# `07` Arrow function

An arrow function is **very similar** to the traditional `function` at first, the biggest difference is the arrow symbol `=>` that goes always before the function parameters:

```js
const sum = (param1, param2) => {
    return param1 * param2;
}
```

See the arrow? instead of `function sum(){` it's `const sum = () => {`. The rest of the function remains the same.

### But why having arrow functions in the first place?

- They are shorter and faster to write.
- When they have just a single line (like a big percentage of the functions that you will make), they can be super small and easy to write. 
- Arrow functions came to fix a scope problem that normal functions have, which requires "binding" especially when working with React. Arrow functions don't require .bind().

## üìù Instructions

Rewrite the syntax of the current function to make it an arrow function.
