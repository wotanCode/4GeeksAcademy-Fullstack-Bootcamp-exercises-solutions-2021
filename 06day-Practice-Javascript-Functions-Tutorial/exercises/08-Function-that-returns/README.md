# `08` Functions that return


Is a very good practice that all functions return something, even if it is "null"; if your functions return something you can then create algorithms that use several functions at the same time. For example, in this particular case we have two functions available:

dollarToEuro: that calculates the value in euros of a given value in dollars.
euroToYen: calculates the value in yen of a given value in euros.

# üìù Instructions:
Using the two functions available, calculate the value of 137 dollars in yen **and print it on the console**.

# üí° Hint
Working backwards, our expected value is in yen. Our available function euroToYen will provide that, and to get to euro we will use the available function dollarToEuro.
