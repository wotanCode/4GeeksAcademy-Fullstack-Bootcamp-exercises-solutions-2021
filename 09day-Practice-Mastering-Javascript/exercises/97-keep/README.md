# `97` keep

## 📝 Instructions 

Write a function called "keep".

Given an array and a keeper element, "keep" returns an array containing the items that match the given keeper element.

Notes:* If no elements match, "keep" should return an empty array.

```js
var output = keep([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 2) 
console.log(output); --> [2, 2]
```
