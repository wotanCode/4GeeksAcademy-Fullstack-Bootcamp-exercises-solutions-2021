# `05.3` Add Items to Array

Add 2 random integers to the "arr" list (no need to loop) and print the array on the console

## ðŸ’¡ Tips:

- You can use the Math.random() and Math.floor() functions to get random numbers, you should do that inside the loop
- You have to use the `.push(item)` function to add the new random number to the array.
