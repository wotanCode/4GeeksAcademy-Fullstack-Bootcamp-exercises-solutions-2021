# `22` Matrix Builder

Matrix Rebuilding Coalitions

After some malicious code, mainly by Mr. Smith, the matrix has some gaping hole and it needs some help to rebuild. Create a matrix of random 0's, and 1's based on a parameter.

# 📝Instructions
Create a function called `matrixBuilder`, which will expect 1 parameter (an integer). 
This number represents the amount of rows and columns for the matrix. Example: 
5 means that the matrix should be 5x5. 
This function should return an array of arrays that represents the matrix. Example: 3 should return:
```md
[
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
```
