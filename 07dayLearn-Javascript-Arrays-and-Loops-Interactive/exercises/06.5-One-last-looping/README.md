# `06.5` One Last Looping

Without using the array.reverse function, please reverse loop (from the end to the beginning) the whole array and print all the items on the console as you go.

The result should be something like this:
```md
Annie
Bart
Cesco
Fernando
Lou
Maria
Pedro
Lebron
Ruth
Kiko
Esmeralda
```

## ðŸ’¡Hint:

1. Use a `for()` loop like we have been using in previous exercises.
2. Remember that arrays start at position 0.
