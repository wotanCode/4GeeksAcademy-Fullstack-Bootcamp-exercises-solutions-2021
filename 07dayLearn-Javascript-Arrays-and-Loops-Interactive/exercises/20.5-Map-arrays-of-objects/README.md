# `20.5` Map array of objects

The most common scenario for the mapping function is for simplifying given arrays, for example:

The current algorithm creates an array with only the names of the people and prints it on the console.

# 📝Instructions

- Please update the mapping function so it creates an array where each item contains the following:

```md
Hello my name is Joe and I am 13 years old.
```

## 💡Hint
You have to get the age of each people based on their birthDate. 
Search in Google "How to get the age of given birth date in javascript"
Inside your simplifier function you have to return a concatenation.

The expected output should look similar but not exactly to this:
```md
[ 'Hello, my name is Joe and I am 32 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Bob and I am 42 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Erika and I am 28 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Dylan and I am 18 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Steve and I am 14 years old' ]
```
