# `06.4` Loop from the half to the end

This loop is not looping at all... because the variables initialValue, stopValue and increasingValue are equal to zero.

# üìù Instructions

Change the value of those variables to make the loop print only the last half of the array.
Change nothing but the value of those 3 variables!

The console output should be something like:

```md
23
48
56432
55
23
25
12
```
