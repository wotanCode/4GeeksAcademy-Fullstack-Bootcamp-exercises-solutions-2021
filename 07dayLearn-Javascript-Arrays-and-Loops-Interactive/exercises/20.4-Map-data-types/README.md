# `20.4` Map data types

Some times arrays come with mixed values and you need to unify them into only one data type.

# 📝Instructions
- Update the map function to make it create a new array that contains the data types of 
  each corresponding item from the original array.

The result in the console should be something like:
```md
[string,string,... ,number,string,...]
```

💡Hint:
Use the `typeof` function to get the data type
