# `07.3` Flip Array

Using a for loop, invert the "arr" array and print the new array it on the console. 

```md
Initial array:  [45, 67, 87, 23, 5,  32, 60];
Final array:    [60, 32, 5 , 23, 87, 67, 45];
```

## :bulb: Hint

1. You should loop the entire array [from the end to the beggining](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340589/are-loops-really-faster-in-reverse).
2. On each loop push all the items (as you go) into a new array, this will be your flipped array.
