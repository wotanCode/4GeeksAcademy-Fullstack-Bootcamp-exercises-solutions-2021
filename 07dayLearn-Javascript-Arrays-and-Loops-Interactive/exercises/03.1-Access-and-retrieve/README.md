# `03.1` Access and Retrieve

Arrays are part of every programming language. They are the way to go when you want to have a "list of elements."

For example, we could have an array that is storing the days of the week:
```js
var myArray = ['sunday','monday','tuesday','wednesday','thursday','friday','saturday'];
```
Every array has the following parts:
- Items: are the actual values inside on each position of the array.
- Length: is the size of the array, the number of items.
- Index: is the position of an element.

![How arrays work](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-arrays-exercises-tutorial/blob/5e6a9b1276ed2b7de1b9bb0240105983c170611c/.learn/assets/DbmSOHT.png?raw=true)

To access any particular item within the array you need to know its index (position). The index is an integer value that represents the position in which the element is located. Protip: Every array starts from cero (0)!

# üìù Instructions

1. Using the `console.log` function, print the 3rd item from the array.
2. Change the value in the position where `thursday` is located to null.
3. Print that particular position.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important note: Use null as a value and not "null" as a string.
```
