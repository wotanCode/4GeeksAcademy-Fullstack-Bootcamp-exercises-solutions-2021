# `04.1` Print the last one

You will never know how many items `myStupidArray` has because it is being randomly generated during runtime using the `generateRandomArray` function.

But don't worry! The property `myStupidArray.length` returns the length of myArray (try console logging it and you will see the length displayed ont he console).

```js
var totalItems = myStupidArray.length;
```

# üìù Instructions

1. Create a variable named theLastOne, and assign it the LAST element of myStupidArray. 
2. Then, print it on the console.
