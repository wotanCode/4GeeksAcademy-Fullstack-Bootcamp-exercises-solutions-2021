# `09.1` forEach Loop

Instead of using the classic `for` statement, there is a new way to loop arrays called [higher order functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRgD1yVwIvE)

It is possible to loop an array using the `array.forEach` function. You have to specify what to do on each iteration of the loop.

```js
/**
 * item: will be the value of the specific item.
 * index: will be the item index.
 * arr: will be the 
*/
myArray.forEach(function(item, index, arr){
		
});
```

# :pencil: Instructions

Right now, the code is printing all the items in the array. Please change the function code to print only the numbers divisible by 14.
