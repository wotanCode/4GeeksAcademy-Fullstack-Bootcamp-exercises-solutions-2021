# `14` Divide and conquer:

## 📝Instructions
1. Create a function called `mergeTwoList` that expects an array of numbers (integers).
2. Loop through the array and separate the odd and the even numbers in different lists.
3. If the number is odd number push it to a placeholder array named odd.
4. If the number is even number push it to a placeholder array named even.
5. Then concatenate the `odd` array to the `even` array (combine them). 

> Remember, the odd array comes first and you have to append the even mergeTwoList.

```js
Example:
mergeTwoList([1,2,33,10,20,4])

// expected console output
[1, 33, 2, 10, 20, 4]
```

### 💡 Hints:

Create empty(placeholder) variables when you need to store data.
