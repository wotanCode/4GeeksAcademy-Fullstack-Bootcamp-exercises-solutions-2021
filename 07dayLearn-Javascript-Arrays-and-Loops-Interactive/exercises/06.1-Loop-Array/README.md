# `06.1` Loop an array

Ok this is the first time you will be looping an array from scratch, please take 6 minutes to watch these video on [how to loop an array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24Wpg6njlYI).

# üìùInstructions

The code right now is printing the first item in the console. Instead of doing that, print all the elements in the array.

You will have to loop through the whole array using a loop.

## üí°Hint

1. Remember that to access the value of a position you have to use the index `console.log(myArray[index]);`
2. [Here is a cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24Wpg6njlYI) explaining how to use the `for` loop to loop arrays.
