# Welcome to Loops

Practice loops in javascript until you become confortable with it, I recomend watching [this short video about loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3ZlQSOcOI0) before starting:

1. For loop.
2. forEach.
3. while.
4. map.
5. filter.
6. find.
7. Loop dictionaries (object literals).

Click `next â†’` when you are ready to start the exercises.
