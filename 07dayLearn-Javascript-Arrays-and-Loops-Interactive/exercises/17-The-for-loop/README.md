# `17` The For Loop Find average

Another way to loop an array with the for loop will be using the IN statement like this:
```js
for (var index in myArray){
    console.log(myArray[index]);
}
```

# 📝Instructions
1. Declare a variable with value 0.

##  #$# 💡HINT:
To print the average, you have to add all the values and divide the result
by the total length of the list.

```js
// The result should be:
27278.8125
Calculate the average value of all the items in the array and print it on the console.
