# `03.2` Retrieve Items

The only way of accessing a particular element in an array is using an index. An index is an integer number that represents the position you want to access in the array.

You need to wrap the index into brackets like this:
```js
var myValue = array[index];
```

# 📝 Instructions

1. Print on the console the 1st element of the array
2. Print on the console the 4th element of the array
