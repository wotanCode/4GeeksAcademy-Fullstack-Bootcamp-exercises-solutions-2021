# `07.1` Find Waldo :smile:

![Finding Waldo](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-arrays-exercises-tutorial/blob/5c8f7b7dbb094e0552565227fc24faad6dc05a13/.breathecode/assets/finding_waldo.jpeg?raw=true)
Have you every played finding Waldo? I used to play it a lot when I was little, this exercise is a digital version of finding Waldo.

# :pencil: Instructions

Please loop this entire array and print the positions where the string "Waldo" is found.

### :bulb: Hint
1. You need to add a conditional inside the loop.
2. Waldo may be upper case or lowercase, compare both values [using toLowerCase()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compare-the-case-insensitive-strings-in-javascript/)

### :egg: Easter Egg:

What if there is more than one Waldo?
