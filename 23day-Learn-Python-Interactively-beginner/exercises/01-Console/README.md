# `01` Console

In Python, we use **print** to make the computer write anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in something called "the console".

Every language has a console, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning (before Windows or MacOS arrived).
Today, printing in the console is used mostly as a monitoring and debugging tool, ideal to leave a trace of the content of variables during the program execution.

This is an example of how to use it:
```py
print("How are you?")
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Use **print** to print "Hello World!" on the console. Feel free to try other things as well.
