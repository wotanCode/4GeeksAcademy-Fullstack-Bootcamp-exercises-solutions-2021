# `08` Your First if...

The current application is prompting asking how much money the user has. Once the user inputs
the amount, we need to **print** one of the following answers:



## 📝 Instructions:

1. If the user has more than $100, we answer: "Give me your money!"
2. If the user has more than $50, we answer: "Buy me some coffee you cheap!"
3. If the user has less or equal than $50, we answer: "You are a poor guy, go away!"

## 💡 Hint:

- Use an If/else statement to check the value of the "total" variable.
