Loops are very useful, you don't have to repeat yourself by writing the same lines many times.

The "**for**" loop lets you run the same code for different values.

```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Create a function called **standards_maker**
2. The function has to print 300 times the phrase "I will write questions if I am stuck".
3. Call the function **standards_maker()**

## üí° Hint:

- You can use the range() function in the for loop.
