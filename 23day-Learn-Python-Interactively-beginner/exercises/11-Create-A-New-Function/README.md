# `11` Create a New Function

As you know, functions are a useful block of code that you can re-use as many times
as you need or want. In the last exercise, you had a function that received two parameters (two inputs) and returned the sum of those. Like this:

```py
def add_numbers(a, b):
  print(a + b)


```

But Python comes with a bunch of "pre defined" functions that you can use, for example:

```py
import random
# Generates a random number between
# a given positive range
r1 = random.randint(0, 10)
print("Random number between 0 and 10 is % s" % (r1))


```

You can use the randint function to get a random decimal number.
randint() is an inbuilt function of the random module in Python3.
The random module gives access to various useful functions and one
of them being able to generate random numbers, which is randint().

## üìù Instructions:

1. Please now create a function called **generate_random** that prints AND returns a random number
between 0 and 9 every time it is called.

## üí° Hint:

- One possible solution involves using two predefined functions: the **randint** or **randrange** function.
- Don't forget to import random.
- Check the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-integers
