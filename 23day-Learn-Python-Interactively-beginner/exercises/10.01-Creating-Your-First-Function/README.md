# `10.01` Creating Your First Function


## 📝 Instructions:

1. The function **add_numbers** is supposed to return the sum of 2 given numbers, please
complete the needed code inside of the function to make it behave as expected.

The exercise should print the number 7 in the console.

## 💡 Hint:

There is a function **"add_numbers"** already declared, it is receiving 2 parameters
(the variables **a** and **b**),  as a developer you were given a task to fill the
function content with the code needed to sum variable **a** with variable **b** and
return the result of that operation.

## Note:
For practicing more with functions, 4Geeks Academy has more than 20 incremental exercises.
