# `10` Calling Your First Function

Functions are amazing because of many things, but mainly because you can encapsulate your code
in pieces and re-use those pieces several times without having to type all that code again.

IMPORTANT: there's a Series of exercises dedicated to Functions, we encourage you to go and finish
those after this first Function exercise. (And then, come back).




## üìù Instructions:

1. Please, write all of your code inside the `my_main_code` function.
1. The function **is_odd** is defined at the beginning of the code, please call that function passing
it the number 45345 and print the result on the console.
