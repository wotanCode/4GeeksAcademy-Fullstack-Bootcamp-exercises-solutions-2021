# `02` Declare Variables

Variables act as a box (container) that lets you store different types of data. This is how we set a variable:
```py
name = "Daniel"
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Declare a new variable with the string value "Yellow" and print the value to the console.
2. Then, print its value on the console using ```print(name)```

## 💡 Hint:

The name of the variable can be whatever you want, but the value inside has to be the string "Yellow".
