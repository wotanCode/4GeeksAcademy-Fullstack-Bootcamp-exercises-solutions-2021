# `03` Print the Variables in the console

You can also use the **print** function to print variables in the console. It's a great way to check their current value, like this:
```py
my_super_variable = 'hello'
print(my_super_variable)
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Declare a new variable called **color** and assign the value "red" to it.
2. Then, print its value on the console (you may have to scroll up in the terminal to see it!)
